      "text": "AJEEP\nBeginning Photoshop Syllabus\nCourse Description\nThis is a beginning course in Photoshop.  It is NOT a photography class.  \nCourse Goals\nIn six, one hour lessons, students will be able to demonstrate basic photo editing skills for \nphotojournalists and other types of photography, including public relations, advertising and art \nphotography.\nUpon successful completion of this course, students will be able to do the following ma -\njor photo editing skills:\nLesson 1: Zoom and navigate through a photo.

A CD with the images required for the lessons is included.  Those images are also \navailable for download but require a working internet connection.  The CD may be copied for \nstudent use.  The photographs do not require permission or royalties.\nA Mac or PC computer is required, preferably with at least 2 GB of RAM.\nAll photographs may be used by permission of the photographer, Brad Shirakawa\nJuly 2012\n1\nIf you had never taken a class in art, could you grade \na painting or sculpture?\nAt the end of each lesson is an ex -\nample of what the photo could  look \nlike when done correctly.  Because \nphotography is subjective , there is \nnot necessarily a perfect result from \nthe use of Photoshop on an image.  \nEach student\u2019s work may look differ -\nent from the other, and different from \nthe instructor\u2019s example , yet may still \ndemonstrate good use of Photoshop, \nmaking grading difficult.\nThis presents a quandary for instruc -\ntors.  Just how do you grade a stu -\ndent whose work is different from \nothers, yet could be just as valid and \ncorrect?\nIf you are not that familiar with pho -\ntography, this can make grading even \nmore difficult.  \nIf the instructor does not know what a \ngood crop is, or good color, just how do you grade?  It would be helpful if \nthe instructor has taken photography \nclasses.\nAt the end of most of the lessons \nis the \u2018final\u2019 version of the photo \nafter Photoshop has been applied. \nI suggest you use it as a guide to \nwhether the student has done the \nwork correctly, or close to.  That \nphoto is also inside the folder \ncalled \u201cinstructor use.\u201d  NOT EV -\nERY LESSON needs to be graded.\nThese lessons are more about prac -\nticing the skills needed to become \ngood at Photoshop, and less about \nwhether an assignment is done per -\nfectly.  The only way to become truly \nproficient at Photoshop is to use it of -\nten, on a variety of images and situ -\nations.  \nThere are no written tests.  Each les -\nson is worth the same amount as the \nothers.\nPart of the power of Photoshop is its ability to inspire \ncreativity and expand the possibilities of photography.  \nI\u2019m not sure you can grade that.  But if students show \nan interest beyond expectations, you have probably suc -\nceeded as an instructor.  If they try something in the soft -\nware on their own yet fail, you have probably succeeded.\nAssignments and Grading Policy\nHow do students show you the finished photo for a grade?  I recom -\nmend you devise a way for them to send/give you the finished image \nin a folder with their name on it, so you can know whose photo it is.Each lesson is de -\nsigned for a one hour \nclass, however, you \nmay find that the class \ncannot get through the \nentire lesson in one \nhour.  \nYou may chose to NOT \nuse all the material for \nthe hour if need be and \neither continue the next \ntime, or simply move \nonto the next lesson.  \nOr you could chose to \nextend the lessons be -\nyond six lessons.  Do \nnot feel bad if your stu -\ndents cannot complete \nthe hour\u2019s lesson on \ntime. \nThe last lesson, number six, \ncan be deleted if you need \nmore time to finish the first \nfive.  First time users of Pho -\ntoshop tend to struggle.  After \nmuch practice, students may \nbe able to get through the en -\ntire lesson in one hour.\n2\nNotes to the Professor\n1) After teaching software for several \nyears, I personally find lecturing in front \nof students to be less than effective.\nSo when I teach Photoshop, I don\u2019t  use \na class session to tell them what they are \ngoing to do the next session.\nI immediately have them open Photo -\nshop, show them around, and have them \nopen pho -\ntos to start \nworking on \nas soon as \npossible .\nI find most books on Photoshop go over \neverything.  I don\u2019t know a single profes -\nsional photographer or graphic designer \nwho knows everything about Photoshop.\nSo my lessons are about real world use.\nBrad ShirakawaI also find that students get lazy.  If I don\u2019t explain it to them, they will not try to figure it out on their own.   \nSo don\u2019t be surprised \nif they ask you over \nand over to explain \nthe lesson again.  It \njust comes with the \nterritory.  Your pa -\ntience can be tested.\n-  The lessons I have \nwritten are based on \nmy experience as a \nprofessional photo -\njournalist and NOT on \nbooks.The sooner they start using Photoshop, the faster \nthey will catch on.  The old \u201clecture hall\u201d style of \nteaching doesn\u2019t work as well for software, in my \nopinion.  So these lessons are written that way.\nI\u2019ve given you and also your students images to prac -\ntice on.  They are set up to demonstrate the lesson \nwell.  \n3\nBeginning Photoshop Schedule\nList the agenda for the semester including where and when the final exam will be held.

This is often done to improve or \nenhance an image within certain guidelines that we \nspecify in photojournalism.\nPhotojournalists usually only make certain changes \nin an image, such as cropping, dodging and burning, \ncolor correction and toning, and resolution.  These \nguidelines have been in place for decades, to pre -\nvent the image from being manipulated to the point \nwhere it is no longer factual or believable.\nThere are many instances of photojournalists going \nbeyond the guidelines.  When exposed, these pho -\ntojournalists usually end up losing their jobs.  \nThe danger lies in that Photoshop makes image ma -\nnipulation very easy and sometimes the manipula -\ntion seems harmless.  It is easy to make a photo -\ngraph appear better or even perfect.  Perfection has \nnever been the goal of journalism.\nPhotojournalism is not art, it does not exist to be per -\nfect.  It exists to tell the most accurate story it can, \ngiven the circumstances.  There is no problem pre -\nsenting a less than perfect image, as long as we do \nour best to tell the story honestly and with integrity.\nThe best photojournalists often make great images, \nregardless of the circumstances.  Their images often \ndo not need much \u2018fixing\u2019 or \u2018photoshopping\u2019 to be \nhighly useful.  \nMost of the lessons herein fit within those guidelines, \nhowever there are times in Public Relations, Art and \nAdvertising where those guidelines no longer apply.\nSo some of the lessons here are not for photo -\njournalism, but for the other kinds of photogra -\nphy used in PR, Art and Advertising. \nETHICSIN  PHOTOJOURNALISM\n6\nIn lesson #1 you will first explain the ba -\nsic  Photoshop interface (the Toolbox and \nPulldown Menus).  Have students open \nPhotoshop and practice finding the items \nnoted- in the lesson.  This will make it eas -\nier for them once they get further into Pho -\ntoshop, and easier for you, too.\nNext you will describe how to get in and \nout of a photo by zooming.  Explain that \nbeginning students will open a photo and \nwork on it, without ever zooming in to get \na better look at it.  They should get used to \nzooming in for many  Photoshop functions.\nPixels and Resolution are hard to explain \nwithout showing students.  Have them \nzoom in enough to see what you\u2019re talking \nabout.  Resolution is one of the most con -\nfusing and poorly understood functions of \ndigital photography and takes much prac -\ntice to comprehend its value.  Resolution \neffects video, audio and web, too.\nIt can seem like just another set of num -\nbers that don\u2019t mean much, until the wrong \nnumbers slow down your website uploads/\ndownloads.  Or the photo needs to be seen \nin print (not the web) and it looks terrible.  \nThe average person has no idea how res -\nolution effects their photos, web experi -\nence, the advertising they see in print or \na billboard.\nThe rest of lesson #1 is about cropping.  \nTell your students that cropping is one of \nthe easiest ways to improve almost any \nphoto.  It can be simple, but can also gen -\nerate much discussion over what crop is \nthe best.  Sometimes there is no concrete \nanswer.\nIntroduction\n7\nLesson #1:\nPhotoshop looks like most \nAdobe products.  There are \npull-down menus across the \ntop and the toolbox is usually \non the left side. \nHave students look through \nthe pull down menus.\nThen click through a few of the \ntools in the toolbox.\nClick once and hold on \nthe Lasso Tool, and it \nwill reveal other related \ntools underneath.\nWe will not go over every tool \nor menu in our six lessons.\nYou do not need to grade \nthis exercise.\nClick once and hold on \nthe Burn or Dodge Tool, \nand it will reveal other \nrelated tools under -\nneath.\nPull Down Menus\nToolbox\nMove Tool\nHand Tool\nZoom ToolCloning ToolCrop ToolLasso Tool\nPolygonal Lasso\nMagnetic Lasso\nDodge Tool\nBurn Tool\nSponge ToolMagic Wand Tool\n8\nLesson #1:\nNavigation and Zoom\nThe first thing we will do is \nnavigate and zoom in on an \nimage.\nGo to the File Menu>Open.  \nBrowse to the folder  01-Crop  \nand open photo \u201c00 Navigate-\nmagnify-1.\u201d\nYou can zoom in and out of an \nimage by:\n-Go to the Toolbox and mouse \nclick once on the Zoom Tool \n(looks like a magnifying \nglass) and move it on top \nof the photo.  Click several \ntimes and zoom IN.\n-Once you have zoomed in , \nfind the HAND TOOL in the \nTOOLBOX and bring it over \nthe photo. Now CLICK ONCE \nand HOLD and you can use it \nto move around the magnified \nimage.\n-Hold down the Alt Key and \nmouse click to zoom OUT.\n-Go back to the Toolbox and \nmouse click twice  on the \nHand tool.  That will quickly \nreturn you to the full sized im -\nage.\nZoom in/out using Key -\nboard Shortcuts in -\nstead:\nHold down the Control Key \nand press the + or - Keys to \nzoom in and out.\nGo to FILE MENU > \nCLOSE.  Do not save any \nchanges you made to the \nphoto.  \nControl Key                 \u2013  Key        + Key\nImage \u201c00 Navigate-magnify-1\u201d\nToolbox\nYou do not need to grade this exercise.  It is sim -\nply to familiarize students with the software.\n9\nLesson #1:\nPixels and \nImage Resolution\nA digital image is made up of \nPixels , which is short for Pic-\nture Elements .  Pixels are the \nsmallest things in a digital im -\nage, they are the atoms, if you \nwill.  More pixels also equals \nmore information.\nWe measure or describe the \nnumber of pixels in an image \nas Image Resolution (Rez) .  \nThe more pixels in a picture, \nthe higher the resolution and \nthe higher the quality.\nSo a high resolution image \nrequires more pixels, or more \ndigital information.  Low reso -\nlution images equal fewer pix -\nels.\nMost photos you see on the \nweb are LOW quality, because \nthe web does not require high \nquality images to look good on \na computer screen.  The web \ncan only display 72 pixels per \ninch, no matter what your com -\nputer\u2019s screen resolution is.\nOpen \u201c01-72 pixels per inch.\u201d\nTry zooming in until you see \nthe small squares that make \nup the image.  Those are pix -\nels.  This is a low quality image \nand it won\u2019t take much before \nyou see the pixels.\nAlso, a high quality image \ntakes longer to see on a web \npage, because it has more pix -\nels to deal with.  Downloading \na high rez photo takes longer.Now open \u201c 01-300 pixels per inch.\u201d  This is a high resolution \nimage.  Zoom in until you see the pixels.  It should take much \nmore zooming to do so.  That\u2019s because there are so many more \npixels in this image.\nWe need high rez, or high quality images for print use in newspapers, \nmagazines, brochures, billboards, flyers, posters, etc.  Just about \nanytime a photo is used in print, a high quality image is required.  A \nlow rez photo would look terrible in print.\nGo to FILE MENU > CLOSE.  Do not save any changes you made to \nthe photo.   You do not need to grade this exercise.\n01-72 pixels per inch. \nThis low quality, low \nresolution, web-suitable \nimage has 72 pixels per \ninch.\n.01-300 pixels per inch. \nThis high quality, high \nresolution print-suitable \nimage has 300 pixels per \ninch, nearly 4 times the \ninformation of the 72ppi \nphoto.  In these exam -\nples, you will not see \nthe difference until you \nzoom in on the images.\n10\nCROP\nCrop or cropping: What is it?\nCropping changes the \nshape of the image by \ncutting part of the image \noff.  Many photos can be \nimproved by cropping.  \nThere is often something \ndistracting in an image that can be re -\nmoved by cropping, therefore improving it.  \nAsk any seasoned professional photogra -\npher and they will tell you that most of their \nphotos can be improved by cropping.\nHorizontal photos can be turned into ver -\nticals, verticals can be changed into hori -\nzontals.  \nCropping can add impact and immediacy \nto the understanding of an image.\nIt can significantly change the way the \nviewer relates to the photo.\nTo NOT crop means you are ignoring one \nof the simplest, yet most important meth -\nods of improving a photo.\nBeginning photographers often ignore \ncropping.  There are practice photos avail -\nable to do more cropping, but almost any \nstudent photo could be used to practice \ncropping.  I recommend you have them \nuse their own photos to practice beyond \nthis lesson.\n11\nLesson #1:\nCropping\nExercise #1:\n-Open image 01-Crop from dead \ncenter.\n-Click once on the Crop Tool in the \nToolbox and bring it over the image.\n-CLICK and HOLD \nand SCROLL across \nthe image to cre -\nate a cropping box .  \nOnce you let go of \nthe mouse, you can \nstill adjust the boundaries of the crop \nbox.  Click on the small boxes in the \ncorners or sides to make these ad -\njustments (see arrows)\nCrop away the top and little from the \nleft and right sides to place the sub -\nject\u2019s head higher in the frame.\n-Double click the mouse to crop.  \nOR hit the Enter Key on the key -\nboard to crop.\nIF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE:\nANY mistake made in Photoshop \ncan be fixed by going to the KEY -\nBOARD and pressing Control + Z \ntogether.  This is the UNDO com -\nmand.\nSee the tiny square boxes on the corners \nand sides of the photo (see arrows)?  You \ncan place the mouse on any top of one, and  \nchange the shape of your crop box.\n01-crop from dead center-1\n12\nMany beginning photographers make \nthe mistake of putting a face in the \ncenter.  Most professional portraits \n(and many paintings) place the head \nhigher, NOT in the center.  Use the \ncrop tool to correct this and improve \nthe photo.\nYou also removed parts of the pho -\nto that were not needed or wasted \nspace.  Professionals do their best to \nNOT waste space in a photo.\n01-crop from dead center-2 / The finished photo.  Use this as a \ngrading guide.  Any photo cropped close to this example would \nbe an A grade.\n13\nIn order to save the im -\nage you changed, do \na Save As instead of  a \nSave.\nGo to File Menu>Save As.   \n1) Set the location to the \nDESKTOP. \n2) Click on NEW FOLDER to \nmake a new folder.\n3) Name the folder with your \nname.\n4) Press SAVE.\nThe photo should appear in \nyour folder.  Ask your instructor \nhow to give this folder/image to \nhim/her.\nBecause you did a SAVE AS \ninstead of SAVE, you may re-\nopen the original photo without \nany of the changes you made.\nDo a SAVE AS  for ALL THE \nPHOTOS YOU ARE TURNING \nINTO YOUR INSTRUCTOR \nand save them in this folder.2\n3\n1\n4\nIf you SAVE instead of SAVE AS, you will make permanent \nany changes you made to the photo, thus making it impos -\nsible for the next student to use the image.  Do a SAVE AS \nfor any photo your are turning in for a grade.\n14\nThere is another way to fix \nmistakes in Photoshop.  Go \nto the Window Menu > His -\ntory.\nControl+Z only fixes the LAST thing \nyou did.  History can fix something \nyou did much earlier.\nWhen the history palette pops up, \nyou can click through the history of \nwhatever you have done to the pho -\nto, allow you go to \u2018back in time\u2019 or \ngo backwards to an earlier version of \nthe work you have done.  \nThe history palette remembers the \nlast 15 steps you made.  If you wish \nto increase this (highly recommend -\ned), go the Photoshop Menu > Pref -\nerences > Performance .\nChange History States to 50 or high -\ner and close the Preferences.\nHistory Palette\n15\nLesson #1:\nCropping\nMany beginning photographers shoot \nfrom too far away.  Or you may decide \nyou want a different composition.\nYou can improve/change the photo \nby using the crop tool to \u201czoom in\u201d on \na subject. \nExercise #2\nOpen the image \u201c02-Crop in tight\u201d\nUse the Crop Tool to turn this \nvertical photo into a horizontal.  \nDon\u2019t be afraid to cut off part of his \nhead.\n02-crop in tight-1\n02-crop in tight-2 / Use this as a grading guide.  If this photo is cropped \nclose to this example, it would be an A grade.Discuss which image \nhas more impact.\nDo a SAVE AS and re -\nname.\n16 15\nLesson #1:\nCropping\nSometimes we shoot a photo a \nlittle crooked or tilted.\nYou can improve the photo by \nusing the crop tool to straight -\nen the horizon line.\nExercise #3\nOpen the image \u201c 03-Crop to \nstraighten horizon. \u201d\n-Click and hold and scroll \nacross the image to create \na cropping box .  Make the \ncropping box SMALLER \nthan the image.\nPlace the Crop Tool Icon \nnear one of the corners, \njust outside of the crop \nbox.\nA small curved arrow  will ap -\npear.  Using the mouse, you \ncan tilt the crop box.\nDouble click inside the photo \nor hit the ENTER Key to crop.\nYou have straightened a \ncrooked photo.  This works well \nfor buildings and other photos, \ntoo.\nDo a SAVE AS and rename.\n03-crop to straighten horizon-1\n03-crop to straighten horizon-2  /  Use this as a grading guide.  If this photo is cropped close to this example, \nit would be an A grade.  The horizon should be straight to receive an A.\n17\nLesson #1:\nCropping\nSometimes we crop things out of \nour photos that are distracting or not \nwanted.\nExercise #4\nOpen the image \u201c04-crop the guy out-\n1.\u201d\nUse the Crop Tool to improve this im -\nage by cropping out the man in the \nbackground on the right side of the \nphoto.  He is not important to the im -\nage and cropping him out makes this \na better photo.\nPhotojournalists would call the fin -\nished image \u2018cleaner\u2019 or \u2018less clut -\ntered.\u2019\nAsk students which image they think \nis better.\nDo a SAVE AS, etc.\n04-crop the guy out-1\n04-crop the guy out-2 / Use this as a \ngrading guide.  If this photo is cropped \nclose to this example, it would be an \nA grade.18\nLesson #1:\nCropping\nSometimes we crop things out of our pho -\ntos that are distracting or not wanted.  \nExercise #5\nOpen the all four of the images \u201805-To crop \nor not to crop.\u201d \nHave your students try cropping these im -\nages, straighten horizon lines if needed, \nand try different crops for practice.  You \ndo not need to grade this exercise.\nThe photos may be cropped in different \nways that are not necessarily wrong.\nDiscuss the different ways of cropping with \nyour students and why they did what they \ndid.  For this exercise, there may not be a \nright or wrong...usually!\nDo a SAVE AS if your instructor wants \nthese photos turned in.  Otherwise do \nNOT save any changes you made to the \nimage.\n19\nLesson #1:\nRotating.\nSometimes a photo needs to be rotated 90 \ndegrees.  This does NOT occur often.  \nExercise #6\nOpen the image \u2018 06-Rotate 4 ways. \u201d  \nGo to Image Menu > Image Rotation.   Try \nrotating the photo 90 degrees four times and \nsee which version works best.  There is no \ncorrect answer in this example.\nNow try Flip horizontal and Flip vertical to \nthe photo and see what happens.  Normally \nin Photojournalism, it is unethical to flip \na picture in this way.\n-Flipping a photo might be done in art, public \nrelations or advertising photography, but never \nin news photojournalism.\n06-Rotate 4 ways  / You do not need to grade this exercise.  You might discuss \nwhich image looks best, although there is no right or wrong answer.\n20\nIMAGE\nImage Adjustments: What is it?\nExplain to your students that what comes \nout of their camera is just the beginning.  \nWhat they think \u201clooks pretty good\u201d needs \nrethinking if they want to improve their  \nphotography and digital imaging.\nMost people think they can take a good \nphoto.  Every company selling them a \ncamera or cellphone with a camera adver -\ntises that the device can do all the work.  \nIf that were true we wouldn\u2019t need Photo -\nshop much.  So ask them to think about \nphotography in this new way.\nAnd this new way is to assume that every \nphoto can be improved somehow in Pho -\ntoshop.  In lesson #2, we will use Image \nAdjustments to further improve or change \nthe image.\nWhen a photo looks dull, lifeless, or the \ncolor is not right, we can use Image Ad -\njustments to fix it.  The photos in this les -\nson are set up in advance to show this.\nThere are many ways to make these ad -\njustments through Photoshop.  (Some of \nthese adjustments are beyond what is in \nthis lesson).\nUsing student work may be more difficult for you.  You \nwould have to evaluate the image and then recom -\nmend what adjustments to make, or let them try on \ntheir own.\n21\nLesson #2:\nImage Adjustments: How to interpret \nLevels - Do NOT grade this lesson.\nWhen first showing Levels to your students, it \nprobably won\u2019t make much sense to them.  The \nhistogram is just a black colored shape.  \nGo to the folder \u201c02-Image Adjust & color \ncorrect.\u201d Open the three photos in the  folder \n\u201c00-Levels\u201d and then go to Image Menu > Ad -\njustments> Levels.  Explain that the shapes \ndon\u2019t mean that much for this lesson, it\u2019s where \nthe shape is  that does.\nNote on the OVEREXPOSED photo of the bricks \nat right, the histogram is heavily weighted to -\nwards the right side, and nearly non-existant on \nthe left, with something in the middle.\nThe right side is an indicator of how much bright \n(or white) area is in the photo, the center repre -\nsents middle colored tones (like the red) and the \nleft side is the dark (or shadow) areas.  So it rep -\nresents this photo that has too much bright area, \nsome middle, and almost no dark area.\nOverexposed.  (too much light when the picture was tak -\nen)  The bricks at the top left are too bright.  Photoshop \ncannot really fix this problem much, it cannot bring back \ninformation that was not recorded by the camera to begin \nwith.  Overexposure is worse than underexposure.\nWhen done examining this image, close it, do NOT \nsave changes.\nmiddle tones shadow areabright areaWhen the black \nshape crawls up \nagainst the end of \nthe histogram, it \nmeans there was \ninformation there \nwas NOT record -\ned by the camera, \nhence the areas \nthat are too bright \nin the photo.\nThe absence of the \nblack shape on the left \nside indicates there isn\u2019t \nmuch dark or shadow \narea in the photo.  And \nthat\u2019s just how this pho -\nto looks, yes?  It looks \nmostly too bright, just \nlike the histogram.\n\u201c00-Levels-overex\u201d\n22\nUnderexposed.   Have your students open this photo and \ncheck the Levels.\nNot enough light when the picture was taken.  The shadow \narea is so dark we can\u2019t see the details in the reddish bricks \nanymore.  While Photoshop can help with an underexposed \nphoto, it cannot bring back information that was not recorded \nto begin with by the camera.Correct exposure.  The proper \namount of light reached the CCD \nor CMOS chip.  Have your stu -\ndents open this photo and check \nthe Levels.\nWe can see the bricks that are in \nthe sunshine and shadow.  The \ncamera did a pretty good job of \ntaking this picture.  When both \nsun and shade are in a photo, \ncameras sometimes struggle to \ndo this correctly. \nThis histogram has shapes in the \ndark area (left side), the middle \narea and the bright area (right \nside).\nNeither the left or right side is \u201cup \nagainst the wall, a good thing!\nThat\u2019s why you can see the brights \nand darks in the photo well.\nThe absence of the black \nshape on the right side in -\ndicates there is no bright \nor white area in the photo.  \nAnd that\u2019s just how this \nUNDEREXPOSED photo \nlooks, yes?  It looks mostly \ndark, same as indicated by \nthe histogram.\nThe black shape is start -\ning to crawl up against \nthe left end of the histo -\ngram.

Levels can teach \nyou about proper exposure.  Rather \nthan just check the Levels, this time we \nwill change them to improve the photo.\nSometimes a photograph is not ex -\nposed perfectly by the camera.  In or -\nder to maximize the tones available in \nthe image, we must check and adjust \nthe Levels.  Levels sometimes allows \nto adjust for an imperfect exposure...\nespecially an UNDER exposed image \n(not enough light reached the camera\u2019s \nCCD or CMOS chip).\nLevels are an indication of the brightest, \nmiddle, and darkest tones in a photo.  If \nthey are not set correctly, the image will \nbe lacking the correct tonal values.  \nA photo with incorrect Levels may ap -\npear dull and lifeless or lacking good \ncolor and contrast.\n(Even after Levels are set correctly, the \nimage could need further adjustment to \nbe pleasing)\nExercise 1\nGo to the folder \u201c02-Image Adjust & \ncolor correct.\u201d\nOpen the photo \u201c01-Levels-1.\u201d\nGo to the  Image Menu > \nAdjustments > Levels\nThe black, oddly shaped blob is the \noddly named histogram.  It represents \nthose tonal values, dark tones on the \nleft, middle tones in the middle, bright \non the right side.\nNote the empty spaces on the left and \nright sides , and the three small triangles \n(see the arrows).\n Histogram\nempty\nareaempty\narea01-Levels-1\nYou will be moving those little triangles with the mouse.  The \nreason why the photo you opened looks lifeless and dull is \nbecause we haven\u2019t set those triangles correctly yet.\n24\n-With the mouse, move the two out -\nside triangles so they are underneath \nthe ends of the histogram.\nDon\u2019t worry about the middle triangle \nfor now.\nPress OK.\nNow look at the photo.  More tones, \nmore color, more life.  \nGo back to Image Menu > Adjust -\nments> Levels  and take a look at the \nhistogram now.  \nIt reaches all the way from the left side \nto the right side, with no empty space.  \nYou have set Levels correctly.  Press \nOK.\nYou should check Levels for every \nphoto.  Some of the time, they will not \nbe set correctly.\nLevels set correctly, and \nthe Histogram looks cor -\nrect now, with no empty \nareas.Do a SAVE AS.\nTry opening the \nphotos \u201cLevels 02 \nand Levels 03\u201d to \nfurther practice \nsetting Levels cor -\nrectly.\n25\nThe photo with the correct levels shows bright areas (highlights), dark areas (shadows) and in \nbetween (mid tones).  The horizon line is a little off, however.\n01-Levels-2 / Use this as a grading guide.  You will have to look at the Levels of each stu -\ndent\u2019s photos to determine if they have set them correctly.26\nLesson #2:\nImage Adjustments: Grayscale (Black and White)\nColor photographs can easily be turned into black and white.  Changing from color to black and white is \ncalled changing modes.\nExercise 2\nGo to the folder \u201c02-Image Adjust.\u201d\nOpen the photo \u201c02-RGB to grayscale-1.\u201d\nGo to the  Image Menu > \nMode > Grayscale\nThe original Red-Green-Blue \n(RGB) image is now black and \nwhite.

You may choose to NOT grade this.\n03-Grayscale to RGB-Duotone-1\n29\nLesson #2:\nImage Adjustments: Color \nCorrection (Toning)\nMany photographs come out of the \ncamera with the colors not true to \nthe original scene.  There are many \nreasons for this. (too many to discuss \nhere)  We can adjust the color of the \nimage through Hue and Saturation, \nand also through Color Balance.\nExercise 4\nGo to the folder \u201c02 image adjust.\u201d\nOpen the photo \u201c04-color cor -\nrect-1.\u201d  \nGo to the  Image Menu > \nAdjustments > Hue and Saturation\nTry moving the Saturation slider  to \nthe right to +60.  You should see a lot \nof blue color, too much.  Increasing \nthe Saturation will often give an indi -\ncation of what colors are dominating \nthe photo.  \nSliding to the left will remove or lower \nthe color , like you did in the Gray -\nscale assignment earlier.\nRETURN THE SATURATION \nto 0, or normal.\nThis photo was shot near \nan open doorway.  Many \nphotos shot in this type \nof lighting are too blue, or \nwhat we sometimes call \ntoo cool   or cold.  \nThink of water, ice or ice -\nbergs, winter or snow.  \nThey often appear blue in \ncolor, hence the term cool \nor cold.  Photos shot in the \nshade also tend to be too \nblue.\nPhotos that are too yel -\nlow or red are sometimes \ncalled warm or hot.\n04-color correct-1\n30\nClick on the \u201cMaster\u201d tab and select \nBlues.  Now try moving the Satura -\ntion slider to the LEFT, to remove \nsome of the excess blue ONLY.\nThis way you only effect the color you \nwant to remove, instead of effecting \nall the colors.  How much do you re -\nmove?  Too much tends to look ar -\ntificial, and can sometimes introduce \ndigital noise.  Sometimes it looks bad \nif you do too much.  Try a setting of \naround -15 or -20 to start.\nTry setting the Master tab to CYAN \nand remove some of this color, too.  \nCyan is blue-green in color.\nYou will  note that this photo is mostly \nblue, cyan, yellow and brown.\nCompare the original version ver -\nsus the desaturated one and discuss \nwhich image now appears more \u2018nor -\nmal\u2019 on your computer screen.\nOnce you have seen this \u2018too blue\u2019 ef -\nfect you will start to notice it on pho -\ntos shot in the shade or indoors near \na window or open door.

Look carefully.  \nRemoving too much color might result in \na lower grade, such as a B or C.04-color correct-1 / Too blue/cyan.\n32\nLesson #2:\nImage Adjustments: Color \nCorrection\nThis photo was shot in the shade and \nis a little too blue.  Some of the time, \ncool or cold tones (blue) are less ap -\npealing on skin tones.\nExercise 5\nGo to the folder \u201c02 image adjust.\u201d\nOpen the photo \u201c05-color cor -\nrect-1.\u201d  \nGo to the  Image Menu > \nAdjustments > Hue and Saturation\nTry increasing  the blue and cyan \nsaturation and you will notice how \nblue/cyan this person\u2019s hair really is.  \nNow desaturate the Blue and Cyan to \nimprove this photo (set the slider to \n-15 or -20 to begin.  Don\u2019t overdo it. \nThe difference between the original \nphoto and the desaturated version \nwill be quite subtle.  Look at the hair \nto see the most change.  \nThis time, DO a SAVE AS  and \nsave this photo in your folder.  \nRENAME it \u201ccolor balance ex -\nample.\u201d  We will use this pho -\nto again shortly.\nDo NOT grade this lesson yet.\n05-image adjust-1\n33\nLesson #2:\nImage Adjustments: Color \nCorrection\nThis photo was shot under very dif -\nficult, poor light on a concert stage.  \nThe lights were red and thus the red \ncolor overly dominates.  We will try to \nnormalize the color for this exercise.\nExercise 6\nGo to the folder \u201c02 image adjust.\u201d\nOpen the photo \u201c06-\ncolor correct-1.\u201d  \nGo to the  Image Menu > \nAdjustments > Hue and Saturation\nBecause we know this photo is too \nred, try setting the Master tab to red \nand reduce or remove some of the \nred.  This may not be entirely suc -\ncessful, do the best you can. \nYou might try desaturating the yellow, \ntoo, and see what happens.  There \nisn\u2019t much yellow in this image, or \nany other color, for that matter.\nThis photo is an extreme example of \ncolor that is off.  But would you be bet -\nter off leaving it unaltered?  It is, after \nall, a photo from a concert where the \nlighting is often colored, and there -\nfore, not necessarily wrong.\nThis can be a point of discussion for \nyour students.Most photojournalists would probably leave the \ncolor unaltered, or make only minor adjustments \nto the color.\nAn art director who needs this photo for a CD \ncover or advertisement might like the red color.  \nMight even INCREASE the red color for further \neffect.\nClose the photo but Do NOT save your chang -\nes when you close this photo.\nYou do not need to grade this lesson.06-color correct-1\n34\nLesson #2:\nImage Adjustments: Color \nCorrection\nSome of the time, cool or cold tones \n(blue) are less appealing on skin \ntones.  This time, we will also ADD \ncolor to enhance the image.  The op -\nposite of blue is yellow, the opposite \nof cyan (blue-green) is red.  So we \nwill add a little bit of yellow and red \nand see the effect.\nExercise 7\nGo to your desktop and open the \nphoto you just saved, \u201ccolor bal -\nance example.\u201d\n  \nGo to the  Image Menu > \nAdjustments > Color Balance\nMove the triangles and try adding \nboth red (+5) and yellow (-5) in the \nShadows, Midtones and Highlights.  \nPress OK.\nDo a SAVE AS.\nCompare this photo to the original.  It \nshould appear warmer (more red and \nyellow).  The original version was too \nblue and cyan.  By desaturating the \nblues and cyans, and adding a little \nred and yellow, you have made this \nimage more pleasing without making \nmajor adjustments to it.\nSkin tones can often look better warm \nthan cold.\nIf you add TOO MUCH red and yel -\nlow, the photo will look unnatural.  Try \nthis to see the effect. \nAdjusting skin tones is one of many things the Color \nBalance control can do, but it is very easy to do too \nmuch.  Many beginners overdo it.  Being conservative \nis usually better.\n35\n05-image adjust-3 / Use this as a \ngrading guide.  Grading this image \nmay be more difficult since the dif -\nference between this and the original \nmay be subtle.  Look carefully.

When done well, \nno one will notice this, but comparing to \nthe original, it will be better.  Photographs \ncan gain more impact and clarity through \nthis process.\nThere are several examples for your stu -\ndents to practice this skill, but you can \nrecommend they try it on their own photos \nand see how they improve.\nThe odd terms burning and dodging come from the \ndarkroom era of photography.  \n37\nLesson #3:\nImage Adjustments: \nDodge (or dodging)\nMany photographs need to be \nlightened in certain areas .\n-\nDodging means to make a se -\nlected area of a photo LIGHT -\nER. \nExercise 1\nGo to the folder \u201c03-dodge \nand burn.\u201d\nOpen the photo  \u201c01-\ndodge and burn 1.\u201d  \nGo to the  TOOLBAR and \nclick and HOLD  the dodg -\ning or burning tool icon until \nyou see the DODGING tool.  \nBring it over the photo .\nWe want the dodging circle to \nbe about the same size as the \narea we are lightening.\nOn the keyboard, press the \nright side Bracket key sev-\neral times to increase the \nsize of the dodging circle.\nPress the left side Bracket \nkey to decrease the size of \nthe circle.\nBe sure you do NOT have the \nCaps Lock engaged on the \nkeyboard.\nTry to make the circle about \nthe size in the example at \nright.\nDodge Tool\nBurn Tool\nSponge Tool\nLeft side bracket  Right side bracket\n-smaller circle   -larger circle\n01-Dodge and Burn-1 38\nLesson #3:\nThe goal is to dodge, or light -\nen the banner at far right of \nthe photo and make it more \nvisible.\nOn the upper left side of the \nPhotoshop screen, find the \nRange and Exposure set -\ntings.\nClick once on the Range and \nset to Midtones at around 25-\n35 percent.\nClick and HOLD AND \nSCROLL with the mouse for \n10 to 15 seconds.

The im -\nage was poorly exposed by the cam -\nera and has white areas that are too \nbright (near the nose and paw)  and \nblack areas that are too dark (right \nside of the cat\u2019s face and eye).\nCan we dodge and burn this image to \nmake it better?\nOpen \u201c03-Dodge and Burn-Cat-1.\u201d\nGo to the menu IMAGE > Adjust -\nments > Levels.\nNote that this time, the histogram ex -\ntends to both ends and is \u201cup against \nthe wall.\u201d  This means there is image \ninformation that is missing or NOT re -\ncorded by the camera.  \nThis photo is OVER-EXPOSED.  Too \nmuch light got to the CCD or CMOS \nchip.  Over exposure is much worse \nthan underexposed, and is difficult or \nimpossible to fix.  \nIf you don\u2019t cook your meal enough, \n(undercooked) you can probably  \ncook it longer and it will be ok.  This \nis like underexposing a photo.  It is \nusually still fixable.\nBut if you OVER cook your food, \nyou probably can\u2019t fix it.  Same for \na OVER exposed photo.  It can\u2019t be \nfixed very well, or not at all.\n\u201cUp against the wall\u201d means the histogram extends to \nboth ends and seemingly beyond.  In this example, the  \nshadow areas and bright areas were not properly re -\ncorded when the photo was taken.\n43\nDodge the shadow \narea on the right \nside of the face\nBurn the white fur near \nthe nose and pawDo not make any adjustments.   \nJust press OK.\nNow try to use what you have learned \nabout dodging and burning and see \nwhat happens.\nDodging the right side of the cat\u2019s face \nwith midtones or shadows does very \nlittle.  That\u2019s because there is little to \nno digital information there to begin \nwith, therefore we cannot dodge this \neffectively.  You can\u2019t dodge the black \nfur because it was never recorded by \nthe camera to begin with.  If you over \ndo this, it will simply look gray instead \nof black.\nThe overly bright area near the cat\u2019s \nnose and paw also contain little to no \ndigital information and therefore can -\nnot be burned very well.  \nBurning highlights at 10-20 simply \nadds graytones to the white area, but \ndoes not add the details of the white \nfur, because the details were never \nrecorded by the camera.\nThe resulting image might be slight -\nly better, but is not very suitable for \npublication.  A better exposed image \nwould be easier to work with.  Some -\ntimes Photoshop cannot fix the im -\nage, especially if it was poorly shot to \nbegin with.\nClose the photo.

So today we will work with the Magic \nWand and Lasso Tools.\nAs you get further into Photoshop, the \nmore these tools will become important, \nso practicing with them is necessary.\nMany functions in Photoshop require these tools.\n46\nLesson #4:\nImage Adjustments: \nSelection Tools\nExercise 1\nThe burning and dodging tools work \nwell for general areas, but there are \ntimes when we want to work on an \narea more accurately and precisely.  \nSelection tools let us do that.\nGo to the folder \u201c04 selection \ntools\u201d and open the photo \u201c01- Mag-\nic Wand-1 .\u201d\nGo to the TOOLBOX and click once \non the Magic Wand.  It looks vaguely \nlike a microphone.  In the upper left \nside of the computer screen, find \n\u201cTolerance\u201d and set to 15.\n \nBring the Magic Wand into the white \nwall on the far right of the photo and \nclick ONCE.  It should select the en -\ntire area.\nSee the dotted lines surrounding the \nwhite wall?   You have used the Mag -\nic Wand to select it.  The Wand works \nby selecting all the pixels that are the \napproximately the same color or tone \nfor you.\nIf this didn\u2019t work, on the KEYBOARD \npress Control + D to Deselect  the \narea, and try again.\nMagic Wand.\nClick \nonce \nhere.01-magic wand-1\n47\nGo to the SELECT MENU > Modify \n> Feather.\nSet pixels between 1 to 3.  Feathering \nwill make the borders of the selected \narea a little softer (less hard edge) \nand will blend what you are about to \ndo more smoothly.\nGo to Image Menu > Adjustments > \nLevels.\nTry adjusting the levels and see what \nhappens.  The only area effected is \nwithin the borders of the selected \narea.\nSo you could use \nthe Magic Wand to \nselect an area, and \nmake it brighter \nor darker, like the \ndodging or burn -\ning tools, but more \nprecisely.\nYou will notice \nthat if you make \nthe area too dark, \nit doesn\u2019t look so \ngood.  The tool \nmay be called \nmagic, but it can\u2019t \nwork wonders.\n01-magic wand-2 / Use this as a grading guide.

The selected area may be either somewhat darker or \nlighter and still be correct.  If Levels are changed too much, the selected area may look pixelized or noisy, \nor just not quite right/unnatural.  If so, downgrade the assignment to a B or C.\nIf the sky is poorly selected, the area around the four globes may appear odd or not well selected.  Nor -\nmally you might downgrade for this, but using selection tools can be tricky without much practice.  Since \nthis is the student\u2019s first time, you might be lenient in grading.\nThe purpose of the selection tool lesson is to learn the software.  Whether you would use selection tools to \ndarken the building or the sky is a subject for discussion.  Most of the time, photojournalists would not do this, or \nwould be very subtle about it.\n50\nLesson #4:\nImage Adjustments: \nSelection Tools\nExercise 2\nAnother way to select a specific area \nto work on are the LASSO tools.  \nThey look like a rope lasso from the \nold American West.\nOpen \u201c02-Magnetic Lasso.\u201d\nGo to the TOOLBOX and find the \nLasso Tools.  You will have to CLICK \nonce and HOLD on the Lasso icon to \nsee all the Lasso Tools.  Select the \nMagnetic Lasso.\nThe Magnetic Lasso works by seeing \nthe difference in contrast between \npixels.  It tries to follow the edge of \nthe object and \u2018snaps\u2019 the drawn line \nto it, like a magnet.\nIt works very well when the object to \nbe selected, like this old movie cam -\nera, is set against a plain background.  \nIf the background were busy, or multi-\ncolored, the Magnetic Lasso might \nnot work very well at all.  You would \nprobably use the regular Lasso in -\nstead.  Try it and see the difference.\nLasso\nPolygonal Lasso\nMagnetic Lasso\nBring the Magnetic Lasso to the edge \nof the old Yashica video camera and \nCLICK ONCE to set an anchor point.\nNow just scroll with the mouse and \nfollow the outside edge of the camera \nall the way around.  It will follow the \nmouse.\nCLICK ONCE to set an \nanchor point and then draw\nall the way around.\n02-magnetic lasso-151\nFollow the edge all the way around, \nincluding the hand.  You should see \nthe dotted lines (sometimes called \nthe \u2018marching ants\u2019).\nWhen you get back to where you \nstarted, a VERY SMALL CIRCLE will \nappear.  CLICK ONCE to complete \nyour selection.\nIF YOU MAKE MISTAKES:\nIf you don\u2019t select all the area you \nwant, you can add \nto the area by hold -\ning down the SHIFT \nKEY.  You will see \na small PLUS SIGN. CLICK AGAIN \nwith the mouse.  Redraw until you se -\nlect the area correctly.  Mouse CLICK \nONCE to complete the re-selected \narea.\nIf you select TOO MUCH, hold down \nthe Alt KEY to get the MINUS sign.  \nClick with the mouse and draw to re-\nmove  the area you don\u2019t want.\nMouse click to complete your de-se -\nlected area.\nTOO MUCHNot enough\nPerfect\nSelection\n52\nOnce you have completely selected \nthe camera and hand, go to the \nSELECT MENU > Modify > Feather.\nSet pixels between 1 to 3.  This \nsmooths your selection.\nNow Go to LEVELS and make some \nadjustments.  The only area effected \nis INSIDE the dotted lines.  Press \nCANCEL when done.\nGo to SELECT > INVERSE.  This will \nreverse the selected area.\nGo to the menu EDIT > FILL.\n\u201cFill\u201d means we will fill the selected \narea with a color, in this case black.\nClick and \nHOLD to \nsee menu \noptions.\nSet CONTENTS to BLACK.\nSet BLENDING to NORMAL\nSet Opacity to 100%\nPress OK.\n53\nDo a SAVE AS. \nBy INVERSING the selected area, \nwe reversed the original selection of \nthe camera.  The background is se -\nlected instead.  Handy!\nYou can do many things with a se -\nlected area, including Levels, Fill, \nand other things beyond the scope of \nthis lesson.\nThis lesson shows you what can be \ndone with Photoshop, sometimes to \nalter the original image beyond nor -\nmal.  \nChanging the background color is \nsomething not usually done in Pho -\ntojournalism .  You might see it done \nmore often in art, PR, or advertising \nphotography.\n02-magnetic lasso-2 / The finished \nphoto.  Use this as a grading guide.  \nIf there is a slight white border around \nthe camera, it\u2019s because your original \nselection wasn\u2019t perfect.  Don\u2019t worry \nabout it for this lesson.\nThe Lasso Tools take a lot of practice \nto get good at.  A reasonable attempt \nto do this assignment is all that is re -\nquired to do this correctly.  You would \ndowngrade if the selected areas were \nso poorly done that a large area of \nwhite still shows around the edge of \nthe camera.\nLasso\nPolygonal Lasso\nMagnetic LassoWhat about the other Lasso tools?  The regular Lasso requires you to \ndraw precisely with the mouse, with no help from the computer.  It can \nbe very useful when the Magnetic Lasso will not work on your image, \nwhich can be very often.  It is harder to use.\nThe Polygonal Lasso draws straight lines.  Click once and draw and \nthen click to set a point, then keep drawing more straight lines.\nFeathering, or smoothing your selection takes practice to get used to.\n54\nLesson #4:\nImage Adjustments: \nSelection Tools\nExercise 3\nOpen \u201c03-polygon lasso.\u201d\nFind the Polygonal Lasso \nTool in the Toolbox.\nFind a point either on the \nwhite building and click \nONCE to set an anchor point.\nWith the mouse, draw a straight line \nuntil you reach a corner, then click \nONCE AGAIN to set another an -\nchor point.\nKeep doing this until you have se -\nlected the area you wish.  When you \nhave completed drawing all the way \naround, you should see a tiny circle \nappear next to the tool.  Click once \nto complete the selection.\nIF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE:\nRemember, SHIFT-CLICK adds \nto your selected area, in case you \nmissed an area.\nAlt-CLICK removes the area.\nIf you need to start over, go\nControl + D to deselect.\nWhen done, try Feathering 1-3 pixels. \nThen try Levels, Inverse, Fills, etc \nas you wish.\nDo a SAVE AS.\nFor further practice, try the regu -\nlar Lasso Tool, set an anchor point \nsomeplace and see if you can draw \nand select an area.  Pretty hard!\n03-polygon lasso-1  / Try starting the Polygonal Lasso Tool \nhere...click once to set an anchor point and draw a straight line \nup towards the top.  When you have completed drawing all the \nway around, you should see a tiny circle appear next to the tool. \nClick once to complete the selection.\nThe regular Lasso Tool1) start here: click once \nto set an anchor point \nand then draw to the \ntop.2) click once to set an -\nother anchor point and \nthen draw to the right3) set another \nanchor point in \nthe corner\n4) set another \npoint in the \ncorner\n55\n03-polygon lasso-2 / \nUse this as a grading \nguide.  \nLevels was applied in \nthe selected area to \nmake it darker in this \nexample.  Too much of \na Levels adjustment \nwill make the area ap -\npear TOO dark or TOO \nlight and a lesser grade \nshould result.  If the \nphoto appears unnatu -\nral, downgrade to a B \nor C.\nIf the area is not selected \nwell or is obvious, a B or C \nmay result.\n56\nCLONE\nClone Stamp Tool: What is it?\nToday\u2019s lesson is \nabout The Clone \nStamp Tool, a copy \nand paste tool.  You \nselect an area of \nyour photo first, then \ncopy that area into another part of the im -\nage.  To clone something is to make an \nexact copy.\nStudents will use this tool to make changes \nto an image that should be imperceptible.\nIt is one of the most dangerous tools in \nPhotoshop because it allows major chang -\nes to occur in an image that are difficult or \nimpossible to detect later.  So this, too, is \nabout the power of Photoshop.  Be sure to \nexplain this to your students.  \nThe Clone Stamp Tool is easily abused, \nespecially for those in Photojournalism.  \nYou can ask your students to try this tool \non their own photos, however most of the \ntime, they will use it without thinking about \nthe consequences.\n \nArt/Public Relations/Advertising photogra -\nphy is less effected by this abuse. \n \n\u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\n    \u2013 Stan Lee\n57\nPress the Alt Key + \nmouse click  once here.  \nYou have just copied the \npixels INSIDE the circle.  \nThen move the circle on \ntop of a spot to fix.  Click \nONCE to paste into the \ncircle.\nContinue to\nAlt+Click to\nfix the rest of the white \nwall as best you can.\nYour goal is to \nclean up the wall, re -\nmove cracks, \nother  items and make it \nlook smoother.\nYou might have to \nchange the size of the \ncircle using the Bracket \nKeys.\nUse the HISTORY \npalette if you do not like \nyour work and want to \nstart over.\nDo a SAVE AS.Lesson #5:\nClone Stamp Tool (Cloning)\nThe Clone Stamp Tool is a copy and \npaste tool.  You select an area of your \nphoto first, then copy that into anoth -\ner part of the image.  To clone some -\nthing is to make an exact copy.\nExercise 1\nGo to the folder 05 \u201cCloning\u201d and \nopen \u201c01-clone-1.\u201d\nFind the Clone \nStamp Tool in the \nToolbox.  It looks like \nan old fashioned rub -\nber stamp.  Do NOT \nuse the Pattern Stamp Tool.\nBring the Cloning Tool into the photo, \nnear the top of the photo on the white \nwall area.\nYou will see a brush circle appear.  \nUsing the bracket keys, make it about \nthe size seen in the photo upper right.\n01-clone-1\n01-clone-2.   This type of repair is usually \nnot ethical for photojournalists.\nBut if you were an art photographer you might \ndo this.\nUse this as a grading guide.  An A grade \nwould result from cleaning up most of the \nwall\u2019s cracks, but this is quite subjective.  \nDowngrade if it looks unnatural or  strange.\nDiscuss whether the image is actually im -\nproved or not. The purpose of this lesson is \nto learn to use the Clone Tool.  A reasonable \nattempt by a student is all that is required.\n58\nLesson #5:\nClone Stamp Tool (Cloning)\nExercise 2\nGo to the folder 05 \u201cCloning\u201d and \nopen \u201c02-clone-1.\u201d\nRemove the writing and symbol on \nthe hat using the Clone Tool.  You will \nprobably have to change the size of \nthe brush circle with the bracket keys.\nDo your best to make this look as \nsmooth as possible.\nUse the HISTORY palette if you do \nnot like your work and want to start \nover.\nDo a SAVE AS.\nPhotojournalists would consider this \nan unethical use of Photoshop.\n02-clone-3 / Use this as a grading \nguide.  The purpose of this lesson \nis to learn to use the Clone Tool.  A \nreasonable attempt by a student is \nall that is required.  Downgrade if it \nlooks unnatural or strange.\n02-clone-1\n02-clone-2\n02-clone-3\n59\nLesson #5:\nClone Stamp Tool (Cloning)\nExercise 3\nOpen \u201c03-clone-1.\u201d\nBring the Cloning Tool into the photo, \njust below the black opening in this \nphoto of a wood plank on the right \nside.\nYou will see a brush circle appear.  \nUsing the bracket keys, make it about \nthe size seen in the photo.\nOn the KEYBOARD, press the Alt \nKey + MOUSE CLICK ONCE in that \nspot.  You have just copied the pixels \nINSIDE the circle.  \nMove the circle up and over the black \narea and CLICK ONCE and SCROLL \nleft.  You will begin to paste into the \nblack area.  When you get to the \nhole, stop or you will copy that, too!\nDo NOT use the mouse to \u201cclick-click-\nclick-click\u201d over and over.  This is an \ninefficient way to use the Clone Tool \nand usually does not look very good.\nMove to the left side of the photo \nand Alt+CLICK again and continue \nto clone over the area until you have \nfilled it in.  Do a SAVE AS.\nCloning can be obvious, so care must \nbe taken to do this well.  It takes a lot \nof practice to get good at this.  \nPhotojournalists do NOT use this tool  \nas shown in this example as it can \nsignificantly alter the image.\n03-clone-4 / Use this as a grading \nguide.

The purpose of this \nlesson is to learn to use the Clone Tool.  A reasonable attempt by \na student is all that is required.  Downgrade if it looks unnatural \nor  strange.\nNow that the students have used the Clone Tool several times, \ndiscuss the power of this tool.  Should it be used to remove or alter \na photo?  When is the proper time to do this?  Why would photo -\njournalists NOT use this tool? \nWould you use the Clone Tool to improve someone\u2019s face to make \nthem appear younger or better?  Discuss the difference between \nshowing a photo of the president of a country versus a photo of a \nmodel advertising a skin care product.04-clone-1\n61\nFILTERS\nFILTERS: What are they?\nFilters do won -\ndrous, if easy \nthings to make a \nphoto fantastic.  \nStudents will use \ntheir skills with \nselection tools, \nlevels, etc, to fur -\nther change the \nimage.\nThis lesson com -\nbines many of the \nskills you have \ntaught your stu -\ndents so far.  It\u2019s \nan excellent and \nenjoyable way for students to practice.\nFilters are rarely used in Photojournalism.\nThe filters themselves require little skill \nto use, however.  A 10-year-old can use \nthem.  It can be hard to make a filtered \nphoto that is truly artistic, despite what \ncould be described as amazing results.\nExplain this to your students.  This lesson \nis more about using the skills they learned \nin the previous lessons.\n62\nLesson #6:\nFilters\nFilters do wondrous, if easy things to \ncreate fantastic images using Photo -\nshop.\nExercise 1\nGo to the folder 06 \u201cFilters.\u201d  You \nmay open ANY of the four photos \nthere for this lesson.\nGo to the FILTER MENU > ARTISTIC \n> Colored Pencil.\nWhen the menu comes up, try all of \nthe filters and see what happens.  \nSome of the filters can take a lot of \ncomputing power to apply and it may \ntake time to show what the filter does.  \nBe patient.\nPhotojournalists would consider this \nan unethical use of Photoshop.  \nScroll through the various Filters avail -\nable under \u201cArtistic\u201d to see what they \nChange \nthese \nsettings \nto further \nadjust \nthe filter.\nChange the \nsize of the \nimage by \nclicking here. 63\nLesson #6:\nFilters\nSome of the Filters won\u2019t be very \nobvious, so don\u2019t be disappointed if \nyou don\u2019t see major changes in the \nimage.  \nI recommend you try:\nARTISTIC\nBRUSH STROKES\nDISTORT\nSKETCH\nSTYLIZE\nTEXTURE\nThe other filters have purposes be -\nyond this lesson.\nYou can add more than one filter to \nthe photo at a time.\nClose the photo, Do NOT save your \nchanges.\nPhotojournalists would consider this \nan unethical use of Photoshop. \nGenerally, the only filter used by pho -\ntojournalists is the unsharp mask fil -\nter.  It is NOT used to sharpen an out \nof focus photo.\nWhen photos are printed on paper, \nthey can lose sharpness for various \nreasons (including dot gain).  Un -\nsharp  mask can be used to make up \nfor this loss. \nAfter students have had a chance \nto look through the various filters, \nthey can close the image without \nsaving.  Do NOT grade this lesson.\n64\nLesson #6:\nFilters\nExercise 2\nLet\u2019s use some of your new Photoshop \nknowledge with the filters.\nOpen the folder \u201cFilters-05\u201d\nOpen the image \u201cFilters-05-1\nUse the Magnetic Lasso Tool to select \nthe top flower.\nGo to SELECT > MODIFY > FEATHER \nand feather 1-3 pixels.\nAdd any filter you want to the selected \narea.  Use a filter that is obvious.\nPress Control + D on the KEYBOARD \nto deselect.\nUse the Magnetic Lasso to select the \nbottom flower.\nGo to SELECT > MODIFY > FEATHER \nand feather 1-3 pixels.\nAdd a second, different filter.  Again, \nfind a filter that makes a big change.\nNOW go to the menu IMAGE > AD -\nJUST > LEVELS.\nTry playing with the Levels to further \nenhance your image... or not!\nMaintain the selected area this \ntime, DO NOT DESELECT.\nFilters-05-1\nFilters-05-2\nFilters-05-3\n65\nHOLD down the SHIFT KEY to add to \nyour selection. Use the Magnetic Lasso to \nselect BOTH flowers.  \nGo to the menu SELECT > INVERSE.   \nYou just reversed the selected area. \nRemember how we made a photo look \nblack and white?  Go to the menu IMAGE \n> ADJUSTMENTS > HUE AND SATURA -\nTION and move the Saturation slider left \nto remove the color of the selected area.\nGo to LEVELS and set them INCORRECTLY, as \nin this example by moving all three triangles far \nto the left.  Normally, we would NOT do this, but \nfor artistic purposes, it\u2019s ok.\nYou are only effecting the area outside the flow -\ners.\nFilters-05-4\nFilters-05-5\n6566\nGo to the menu SELECT > INVERSE \nagain.   You just reselected both flowers.  \nGo to LEVELS and set them INCORRECT -\nLY again, as in this example by moving all \nthree triangles to the middle.  Normally, we \nwould NOT do this, but for artistic purposes, \nit\u2019s ok.\nThe resulting photo demonstrates the power \nof Photoshop to alter images.  Be careful \nwith this power to alter reality!  ANYONE \ncan alter a photo very easily.\nUse the HISTORY palette if you do not like \nyour work and want to start over.\nDo a SAVE AS .\nPhotojournalists would not use Photoshop \nto produce this type of image for a newspa -\nper.\nFilters-05-6 / You may use this as a grad -\ning guide, but there will be a nearly infi -\nnite amount of variation in this image.  \nYou may decide to not grade it if you wish.\nThis image should appear unnatural but \nperhaps spectacular. \n  \nThis is the END of your lessons!
